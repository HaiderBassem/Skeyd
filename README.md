# Skeyd **Skeyd** is a simple GUI utility for managing keyboard remapping profiles using [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) on Linux. This program does **not** modify your keyboard map directly — instead, it generates and applies configuration files for **keyd**, so **keyd** must be installed and running first. ## Prerequisites Make sure you have `keyd` installed and enabled: ```bash git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd cd keyd make && sudo make install sudo systemctl enable --now keyd ``` ## Build Clone this repository and build it using CMake: ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Skeyd.git cd Skeyd mkdir build cd build cmake .. make ``` ## Usage Launch the Skeyd binary. Create or load `.txt` keyboard mapping profiles. Double-click a profile to apply it (requires `pkexec` privileges). All profiles are saved under: `~/Skeyd/profiles`. **Note:** Applying a profile overwrites `/etc/keyd/default.conf`. ## Profile Format Each profile is a simple `.txt` file with sections. Example: ```ini [main] key1 = value1 key2 = value2 [other] # other config... ``` ## Features - Create new profiles - Load existing profiles - Apply profiles safely with `pkexec` - Delete unwanted profiles ## Disclaimer You must have keyd correctly installed and configured. Changing keyboard mappings may affect your system input — proceed with caution.
